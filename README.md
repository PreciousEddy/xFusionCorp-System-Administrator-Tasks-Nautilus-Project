## Task 1: Create a Linux User with non-interactive shell

Description: This task involves creating and managing user accounts on various systems and platforms within the xFusionCorp network. The non-interactive shell is commonly used for service accounts or accounts that do not require direct shell access..

## Task 2: Automating Backup Process - xFusionCorp Industries

Description: As a system administrator, this task is responsible for automating the backup process that was previously performed manually by the xFusionCorp Industries system admins team. To automate this task, the team has developed a new bash script named xfusioncorp.sh. The script has been copied to all required servers, including App Server 1 in Stratos Datacenter.

## Task 3: Linux TimeZone Settings

Description: During the daily standup, it was pointed out that the timezone across <Nautilus Application Servers> in <Stratos Datacenter> doesn't match with that of the local datacenter's timezone which is Australia/Lord_Howe. This task involved Changing the Application Servers Timezone to the Local Datacenter timezone.

## Task 4: Create a Cron Job Linux Server -xFusionCorps

Description: The Nautilus system admins team has prepared scripts to automate several day-to-day tasks. They want them to be deployed on all app servers in Stratos DC on a set schedule. Before that they need to test similar functionality with a sample cron job.

## Task 5: Create a custom Apache User named jim on the App server 3 in Stratos Datacenter

Description: For security reasons the xFusionCorp Industries security team has decided to use custom Apache users for each web application hosted, rather than its default user.

## Task 6: Create a group named ```nautilus_developers``` in all App servers

Description: There are specific access levels for users defined by the xFusionCorp Industries system admin team. Rather than providing access levels to every individual user, the team has decided to create groups with required access levels and add users to that groups as needed.

## Task 7: Linux Add A User Without a Home Directory

Description: The system admins team of xFusionCorp Industries has set up a new tool on all app servers, as they have a requirement to create a service user account that will be used by that tool.
